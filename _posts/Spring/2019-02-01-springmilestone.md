개발자로서의 커리어를 위해 기술스택을 쌓기위해 스프링을 공부하기로 시작했다. 이미 개발하고 있는 서비스가 스프링이기도 하고, 많은 서비스들이 스프링을 이용하여 제공되고 있다는 생각에 무작정 시작했다. 공부를 시작한지 2주 생각보다 헛돌며, 시간이 낭비된다는 생각이 강하게 들어 다시한번 목표를 상기하고 나아갈 방향을 다잡아야 할 시간. 이를 위해 글을 쓰며 생각을 정리한다.

1. 목표는 위대하게!  
제일 먼저 시작한 작업은 [깃헙 프로젝트](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce)에 컨트리뷰션을 하는 것이었다. 하지만 생각보다 코드의 양이 방대하고 스프링을 아얘 모르기 때문에 스프링에 대해 공부하고 시작을 하자 마음먹었다. 그 다음 목표를 잡은게 내가 만드는 작은 쇼핑몰 이었다. 이를 위해서는 프로젝트를 구성하고 환경 설정을 해야하는데 이 조차 버거워 작은 게시판으로 목표를 변경했다. 하지만 이 또한 마찬가지의 문제. 결국 목표를 잡고 거꾸로 작은 것 부터 부러뜨리면서 가기로 정했다.

2. 시작인 반  
일단은 튜토리얼을 진행하고 기본 개념들과 용어들을 익숙하게 만들어야 했다.
스프링의 동작과정은 어떻게 되는지, 왜 스프링을 쓰는지, MVC 어떤 구조인 이해하고자 한다. m에서의 mysql과 jpa가 무엇인지 왜 쓰는지 공부하고, 기본 mvc모델을 이용해서 요청과 응답을 처리해보자.

3. spring을 공부하면서 어노테이션을 왜 쓰는지 어떻게 써야하는지 공부하자.

아래는 공부해야 할 스프링의 가이드를 나열한다.
